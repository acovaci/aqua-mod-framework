# Aqua Mod Framework for Factorio

This is a mod framework for Factorio that provides a set of tools to help you create mods. It is
designed to be easy to use and to provide a consistent way to create mods, so that you can focus on
creating the content you want to add to the game instead of endless configuration files.

## Goals

1. **Easy to use**: The framework is easy to use, with a minimum of boilerplate code and 
   configuration.
2. **Static Type Checking**: The development setup this framework provides uses
   [Teal](https://github.com/teal-language/tl) to provide static type checking.
3. **Modpack Support**: Aqua introduces a new paradigm for modpacks, allowing you to dynamically
   define modpacks based on the mods in the current project.
5. **No Watermarking**: I am not adding any needless notices to your files. The only thing that will
   be added to the files is a comment containing the framework version. This is to help with
   keeping track of what version of the framework was used to create the mod. If you are not
   comfortable with this, you can remove it without any issues. No questions asked.
6. **Try not to break the VSCode Mod Development Extension** (but I reserve the right to change my
   mind on this one): I am trying to make sure that the VSCode Mod Development Extension still works
    with this framework, but I am not going to guarantee that it will always work.

## Can I use this?

Absolutely! The framework is free to use and modify. However, I will bring something to your
attention: From my experience, Factorio mods tend to not be open source. A lot of them are source
available, but with a license that prohibits modification and redistribution. If you are planning on
using this framework to create a mod, due to the Affero GNU General Public License v3.0, you will
have to make your mod open source and licensed under the same license. If you are not comfortable
with this, I would recommend not using this framework.

If you are planning on using this framework to create a mod, I would love to hear about it! Feel
free to share your project with me, post it in the *Discussions* tab, or send me a message. If you
want to share your project with the world, I would be happy to include it in a list of projects that
use this framework. But I will not do so without your permission and request.
